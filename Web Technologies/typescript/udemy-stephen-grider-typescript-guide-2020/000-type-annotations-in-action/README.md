# Section 3: Type Annotations in Action

## Type Annotations
We tell the typescript what type we want on variables, functions, objects

## Type Inference
Let typescript decide what type we want on variables, functions, objects

## String vs string
```typescript
let s1Js = new String("This is a JS way of initializing a Text as object"); // [String: 'This is a JS way of initializing a Text as object']
let s2Js = "This is JS literal" ; // This is JS literal

let s3Ts: string = "This is a varible with type `string` for storing Text" // This is a varible with type `string` for storing Text
```
