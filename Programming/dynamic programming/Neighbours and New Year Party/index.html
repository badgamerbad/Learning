        The President of the society, Mr. Singh, is a wise man and know that neighbours in society don't like each other. Also, he don't wish to become bad in front of people. So, he came up with an idea to design a program which will provide the list of integers forming maximum sum and thus all the members of the list will be given the gifts. The only problem with this idea is that he don't know programming so he is asking you to provide the correct list of integers. The people may be annoying but are smart and will fight if the list provided by you doesn't form the maximum sum.

    <p>
        Note: The integer written on ticket of individuals may or may not be unique. In case, when there are two list with equal maximum sum, the list with first greater element would be considered. For better understanding, look at the explanation of Test case 4 in Sample Test Case. The tickets with integer 0 are not considered for winning the gifts and there is atleast one ticket with positive integer.
    </p>
    <p>Test Case 1: Maximum sum which can be formed is 12. Element considered 8, 4. Note that Output is printed from the reverse side of the array which is TRUE for all the test cases without the space. So, the output is 48.</p>
    <p>Test Case 2: Maximum sum which can be formed is 4. Element considered 3, 1. Output = 13.</p>
    <p>Test Case 3: Maximum sum which can be formed is 12 as by taking any other element value of maximum sum decreases.</p>
    <p>Test Case 4: Maximum sum which can be formed is 8 by taking 3, 5 or 4, 4. But the output is 4, 4 as 3 is smaller than 4.</p>
    <p>Test Case 5: Maximum sum which can be formed is 10.</p>
    <p>Test Case 6: Carefully observe that output is 3 but not 03, as tickets with 0 are not considered for winning. Though 0 and 3 can be in the list of maximum sum.</p>
