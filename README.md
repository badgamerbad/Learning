# Learning (Take control of everything...)

This is repo containing all my studies, the path as a learner. This is the place where all the interesting, trial and error, do mistakes, don't give up materials are joined together to create stuff which is needed to build things which will solve real-time problems and will help us live a better future with prosperity, dignity, and pride.

If you feel this place is helping you feel free to make use of it and make the world a better place.
